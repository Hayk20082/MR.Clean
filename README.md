# MR.Clean
is an artificial intelligence-powered system designed to automatically recognize and classify household waste using computer vision. The system helps reduce human error during waste disposal and supports environmentally friendly recycling practices.

The goal of the project is to create an intelligent waste management system that, using a camera and artificial intelligence, automatically determines the types of waste (plastic, glass, paper, etc.) and directs them to the appropriate container. This will improve the efficiency of waste sorting and reduce the impact on the environment.

What problem does the project solve?
In today's world, most people do not sort their waste, which makes recycling more difficult and expensive. Plastic, glass and paper are often thrown together, polluting the environment and reducing the possibility of reuse.
This project solves the problem of inefficient waste sorting and low environmental awareness.

Solution
The proposal envisages the development of a smart trash can equipped with:

A camera that recognizes the type of waste using a neural network.
A microcomputer (Raspberry Pi) that processes images and makes decisions.
With servomechanisms that open the correct compartment for a specific type of waste.

The software uses machine learning algorithms that have been trained on images of different types of waste (plastic, glass, paper). Thus, the device automatically sorts waste without human intervention.
Expected results
Reduction in the amount of unsorted waste.
Increasing the level of recycling and environmental awareness.
Creation of a convenient and modern waste sorting method.
The possibility of integrating the system in schools, offices and public spaces.
